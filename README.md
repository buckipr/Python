# What is Python?

Python is an open source programming language available for Windows, Mac, and *nix

* interpreted language: write scripts and run them with the Python interpreter
* there are many modules (libraries) that provide additional tools
* largely an object-oriented language
  + users create (instances) of objects
  + objects have attributes (data) and methods (functions that do stuff)
* there are two major versions (2 and 3)
  + development and support for version 2 will stop on January 1, 2020

# Why use Python?

* Python is very useful for general programming tasks (and a popular tool for developing software)
* Excellent tools for analyzing and wrangling data

  + [SciPy ecosystem](https://www.scipy.org/) 
* Machine Learning
  + [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
  + [tensorflow](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/) & [kersa](https://keras.io/)
  + [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

# Getting Started

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is a popular data science platform that includes a navigator
interface for installing software and libraries (Python, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebooks, R, RStudio, etc.).
It also support virtual environments, which are software bubbles that contain specific versions of
the software.

# Why Python instead of R/Stata/SAS

You don't have to choose!

* R package: [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/)
* [Stata integration](https://www.stata.com/new-in-stata/python-integration/)
* [SAS integration](https://developer.sas.com/guides/python.html)
